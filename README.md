# React To-Do List Project

## Overview

This is a collaborative project to build a To-Do List application using **React** and **Bootstrap**. The project is split into two parts:

- **Hamza's role**: Focuses on the structure and styling of the application.
- **Ahmed's role**: Implements functionality such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.

---

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**: Users can type a task in the input field and add it to the list.
2. **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks using a delete icon.
3. **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Clicking a task will apply a line-through style.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Hamza's Responsibilities

- **Structure**:
  - Create the layout of the application using React components.
  - Use Bootstrap classes for responsive design.
- **Styling**:
  - Use `react-icons` for the delete button.
  - Style the application to make it visually appealing.
  - Add custom CSS for hover effects, completed task styles, and icon interactions.
- **Ensure compatibility**: Ensure the UI is prepared for dynamic functionality.

### Ahmed's Responsibilities

- **Functionality**:
  - Handle input changes and manage the task state.
  - Implement functionality to add tasks to the list.
  - Implement functionality to delete tasks.
  - Handle the logic to toggle the completed state of tasks.

## Component Breakdown

### **TodoList Component**

- **Hamza's Part**:
  - Set up the structure using Bootstrap cards, input groups, and lists.
  - Add placeholders for dynamic task rendering.
  - Style components using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- **Ahmed's Part**:
  - Implement functionality to handle state for tasks (e.g., `useState`).
  - Dynamically render tasks in the list.
  - Add event handlers for task actions (add, delete, mark as complete).

## Additional Notes

1. Use `React Icons` for the delete button (“RiDeleteBin6Line”).
2. Apply the "Press Start" font for input fields and "Playfair Display" font for other elements.

   - Fonts can be imported from Google Fonts:
     ```css
     @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@400;700&family=Press+Start+2P&display=swap");
     ```
   - Add them to `App.css`:

     ```css
     body {
       font-family: "Playfair Display", serif;
     }

     input {
       font-family: "Press Start 2P", cursive;
     }
     ```

3. Tasks should have a hover effect for better UX.

## How to Collaborate

1. **Branching**:

   - Create separate branches for structure/styling and functionality.
   - Merge changes into the `main` branch after review.

2. **Testing**:
   - Ensure both functionality and UI elements work seamlessly.
   - Test the app in different screen sizes (Bootstrap responsiveness).

---

## Future Improvements

- Add categories or tags for tasks.
- Implement local storage to save tasks.
- Add a "Clear All" button.

Happy coding! 🚀
